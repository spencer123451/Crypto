Crypto Price Prediction with LSTM & Random Forest

This project applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict cryptocurrency price movements. It integrates technical indicators, Random Forest classification, and an LSTM model to analyze historical price data and forecast future trends.

Features:
Fetches and processes crypto price data
Computes RSI, MACD, and signal indicators
Uses Random Forest for bearish signal classification
Implements an LSTM model for price prediction
Visualizes technical indicators and predictions

Usage: Simply define your assets, set a date range, and run the processor!
